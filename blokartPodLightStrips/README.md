# blokartPodLightStrips

_NOTE/Caveat: this is still a work-in-progress. It should work correctly, but I haven't create a release yet. YMMV_

## FwdPortStrip and FwdPortStrip
There are two Arduino sketches here, one for the starbord and one for the port light-strip controllers.

There is also a shared file `PodStripBase.h` in the main directory that is referenced in the two sketch directories via a symbolic link.

## WS2812b_and_ATtiny85_Demos

This directory contains some test sketches.
